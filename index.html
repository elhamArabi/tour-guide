            <p class="sub-info-description">The Vasa ship capsized and sank in Stockholm 1628. After 333 years on the
                seabed the mighty warship was
                salvaged and the voyage could continue. Today Vasa is the world's only preserved 17th century ship.</p>

            <p class="sub-info-description">The Old Town, unsurprisingly, is the oldest part of Stockholm. It's
                certainly the tourist's go-to
                destination, but that doesn’t detract from its architectural and otherwise urban beauty.</p>

            <p class="sub-info-description">ABBA The Museum is more than an ordinary museum. Naturally, the members’
                costumes, gold records, original
                items, memorabilia, and much, much more are here. But at this museum you are an important part of the
                experience!</p>
